In first task I have created 3 variables for input - a, b, c. I used three simple if statemnts for swaping method - if one variable is bigger, it will swap places with another one and in the end we have an output using comman print. The script checkes all three possible cases - if a > b, if b > c and finally just in case a > b. No matter the input, the sorting will always be from smallest number to greatest. This tasked allowed me to practice inputing different integer variables and sorting them with the help of swapping. It is easier to assign value to addititional variable (x) and not loose the value in the process. All in all, this task is useful to practice sorting and value swapping in Python.
In the second task I remembered loop command and the counter value from homework number 3. Firstly, I have created a list with elements of different types. For this task we need to count only string elements, that is why, secondly, I assigned string counter and set it to zero. The loop begins with checking the element in a list and if its type is string it will add +1 to string counter. In the end I wrote print command to see how many string elements we totally have. In my list it is 3. To conclude, I practiced loop command in python script and counted one specific element type in the list. Now I know better about element types and how to count them in the list in Python.
